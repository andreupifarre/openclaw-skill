Micro drills (10–20 min). Pick ONE that targets the weakest pattern.

DSA:
- Two pointers: write template + explain pointer move rule
- Sliding window: write invariant + when to shrink
- BFS: queue + visited + level traversal skeleton
- DFS: recursion + visited + cycle handling
- Binary search: invariant (lo/hi) + termination + mid calc
- Monotonic stack: maintain order invariant + pop condition

Frontend:
- Debounce: implement + list 3 edge cases (leading/trailing/cancel/flush)
- Throttle: implement + compare to debounce
- Closures: explain capture + write a bug example
- Promises/async: error propagation + finally semantics
- Event loop: microtask vs macrotask ordering (no code needed)
